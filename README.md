# Tetris-game

This is a tetris game I built using C++! The game was initially supposed to be managed and rendered with SDL
but I am having some difficulty with installing the necessary packages on my system. I am either going to fix the SDL issue
or think about transferring this game over to Unity.

Fear not, all the code is still available to view!

Currently in the process of being tested and deployed! Thanks for your patience :)
